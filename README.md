# Source-BSP-Loader-
Map importer for Valve's BSP File. Imports most geometry, triggers, as well as textures into the Unity Engine.
Started as a personal project to import BSP files from Vampire: The Masquerade â€“ Bloodlines.

## Currently 'Supports' (with some jankiness):
* BSP v17 (VTMB)
* Some Entity functionality
  * Skybox
  * Sprites
  * Triggers
  * Func

## Known Issues:
* Skybox shader

## Goals:
* Load models (MDL)
* More Entity functionality
